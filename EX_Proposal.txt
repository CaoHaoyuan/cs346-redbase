CS 346: EX Component Proposal

- Master node => Creates children data nodes when needed
- Communication among children nodes? Subdirectories with dump files?
- Setup milestones

- Milestone 1: Support multiple nodes and simple whole table scans across them
    - SM Component command to create a distributed database (multiple nodes)
    - Fragment data across the nodes (simple / user specified)
    - Communication among the nodes and with the master node
    - Full table scan by UNION of fragmented result sets

- Milestone 2: Support INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on the relations
    - Command issued by the master node to the appropriate child data node
    - Query executed by the child node

- Milestone 3: Support distributed JOIN
    - Move data of a relation to all nodes (Add extra operators in the query plan)
    - Perform join at each child node and UNION of result sets at the master node
